# Portfolio Site
Full Stack JavaScript project 6. A personal portfolio site built with Node and Express.

## Built With
* Node.js 
* Express.js
* Pug templates 
* Nodemailer

## Features
In addition to the base templates, I have added the following features: 
* Customized fonts and colours
* CSS Transition transforms applied to image thumbnails 
* A favicon
* A functioning contact form 
    * (Though it functions, Gmail blocks the emails it sends in production. This is something to 
    fix in the future.)
* Simplification and customization of the about page
* (note: please excuse the profile picture, I do not currently have a good picture and can't get one until I can get a haircut!)
